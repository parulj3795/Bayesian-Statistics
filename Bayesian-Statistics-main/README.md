# Bayesian-Statistics
Bayesian statistics and numerical techniques of data analysis

Re-learning Bayesian Statistics from ICIC Data Analysis Workshop (2018)

**Workshop Summary:** We will run a 4-day course/workshop on statistical methods and tools for data analysis, aimed at PhD students, postdocs and any researchers interested in understanding Bayesian statistics and numerical techniques of data analysis. The course plan is to combine lectures with hands-on computational work in the afternoons. It will concentrate on setting down firm foundations of principled Bayesian data analysis, but a feature of the workshop will be a substantial element of hands-on classes where participants will learn how to apply the ideas in practice. It will be hosted by the Imperial Centre for Inference and Cosmology (ICIC) at Imperial College.
